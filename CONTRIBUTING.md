## Contributing to HDWallet

#### Submitting an Issue

- **Do not open a GitHub issue if the bug you found is a security
  vulnerability**.

  Please see ShapeShift's [responsible disclosure program](https://corp.shapeshift.io/responsible-disclosure-program/).

- When contributing to HDWallet, please discus the change you want to make via
  a GitHub issue before making a change and submitting a PR.

#### Submitting a Patch

- Open a pull request with the patch.

- Make sure your PR description clearly describes the problem that you've
  solving, and how this patch achieves that goal. Include a link to the
  relevant GitHub issue.

- Changes that only fix whitespace / formatting will generally not be
  accepted. Drive-by style fixes are fine when working on adjacent areas of
  the code, but please put them in a separate commit from functional changes.

- Where possible, please provide unit tests / integration tests that
  demonstrate new functionality is working.

- The .gitignore file has been configured to act as a whitelist, meaning
  newly added root-level files / subdirectories will not be tracked by
  default and will need to be added manually to the .gitignore file.

#### Getting Your PR Accepted

Our maintainers are committed to reviewing patches in a timely manner. That
said, we do have other things on our plate, so please be patient.

In order to ensure high quality of the codebase, we require signoff from at
least one ShapeShift Fox. If you use GPG, feel free to sign your commits.

Once your patch has been reviewed and has been accepted, you are free to merge it.

Happy HODLing,

ShapeShift Team
